## Points/Goals, tasks and how to approach them..

### Some random ideas rearding readers specially hdf5

- Create a descriptor how to read the data
   - Where is the data
   - geolocation. size, projection, ...
   - what operations to do on the data: flipRightLeft, flipUpDown, transpose, etc..  

- Try to do the transfor jsut after reading the data
- Try to have each operation called separately. This keeps the code clean.
- tbc
