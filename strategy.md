## Points/Goals, tasks and how to approach them..

### Some random ideas rearding readers specially hdf5

- Create a descriptor how to read the data
   - Where is the data
   - geolocation. size, projection, ...
   - what operations to do on the data: flipRightLeft, flipUpDown, transpose, etc..  

- Try to do the transfor jsut after reading the data
- Try to have each operation called separately. This keeps the code clean.
- tbc 

#### A suggestion to have a description of the important data structurs expected as an output from some function.
#### Add a development step which is call quality controle of the code. Does it follow tha standard or not. spcially for interfaced and returned objcts.
